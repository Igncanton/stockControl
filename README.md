Proyect created for my JavaScript course

This is my final project I created for the JavaScript course in CoderHouse.

I decided to go for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application where the main idea was to apply everything we saw throughout the course within an only project.

. It makes use of the local storage, where you can add, edit or delete within different users.

. As well as creating everything dinamically within the DOM

. Each user has it's own invidual session with their own individual things added
